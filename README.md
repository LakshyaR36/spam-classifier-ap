# ‚úâÔ∏è Spam Classifier App

This project is a simple yet effective web application that helps identify whether a text message is **spam** or **not spam**. It combines natural language processing (NLP) with machine learning to make accurate predictions, all wrapped in an easy-to-use Streamlit interface.

## üåü What This App Does

- Takes in any text message you provide
- Processes it using smart NLP techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming
- Converts the text into numerical features using TF-IDF
- Feeds the features into a trained model to predict if it's spam
- Shows the result instantly on the web interface

---

## üß∞ Built With

- **Python 3.9+** for core logic
- **Streamlit** for the web interface
- **scikit-learn** for training the classification model
- **spaCy** and **NLTK** for text preprocessing
- **pickle** for saving and loading the model and vectorizer

## üéØ Why This Project?

This project is a hands-on demonstration of how machine learning and NLP can come together to solve real-world problems like spam detection. It's also a great way to explore deploying ML models in a clean, responsive app.
